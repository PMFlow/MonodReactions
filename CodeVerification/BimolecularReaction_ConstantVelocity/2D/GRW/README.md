- 'main_2D_ReactTransp_testGRW.m' is the main program, based on a non-iterative scheme, which is used to test the 
	convergence of the unbiased GRW solver through comparisons with an analytical solution of advective-
	diffusive transport with nonlinear bimolecular reactions in case of constant flow velocity and \theta=1.

- 'GRW_2D.m' is the function for the nonreactive advection-diffusion step computed with the unbiased GRW scheme.

- 'reaction.m' is the function for nonlinear bimolecular reactions.
