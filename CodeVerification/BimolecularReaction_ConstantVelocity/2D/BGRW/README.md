- 'main_2D_ReactTransp_test.m' is the main program, based on a non-iterative scheme, which is used to test the 
	convergence of the BGRW solver through comparisons with an analytical solution of advective-diffusive 
	transport with nonlinear bimolecular reactions in case of constant flow velocity and \theta=1.

- 'BGRW_2D.m' is the function for the nonreactive advection-diffusion step computed with the BGRW scheme.

- 'reaction.m' is the function for nonlinear bimolecular reactions.
